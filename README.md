# Matrix
When I was in Community College, one of my first projects was to create a program that takes two 3x3 matrices and 
perform certain operations on them. Since I was brand new to programming, the original code that I wrote was extremely messy 
and would only print out answers in the console. In addition, this program was very linear. Since I have had an additional 
programming class at Virginia Tech - and one more at the Community College - I have decided to redo the project. I wanted to create a
Matrix object this time, which seems less efficient than just manipulating arrays, and also try outputting the information in a separate
window. For now, this is just a base and I may end adding on to it like allowing the user to input directly into the window but
this was just a quick redo.
